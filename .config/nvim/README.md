# ðŸ’¤ h0tw4t3r's LazyVim config

This is *h0tw4t3r's* [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) configuration.
I don't expect anyone to use it, but feel free to do so if you want.

## TODO

- [ ] Add a plugin to connect Biome or ESLint server depending on the
     closest config found.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
