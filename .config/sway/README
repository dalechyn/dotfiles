Consider setting up udev rules.

Normally, users are prohibited to alter files in the sys filesystem. It's
advisable (and recommended) to setup an "udev" rule to allow users in the
"video" group to set the display brightness.
To do so, place a file in /etc/udev/rules.d/90-backlight.rules containing:

SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", ACTION=="add",
RUN+="/bin/chgrp video /sys/class/backlight/%k/brightness",
RUN+="/bin/chmod g+w /sys/class/backlight/%k/brightness"

to setup the relevant permissions at boot time. These rules are very
conservative: only the display brightness can be controlled, and nothing else.
Do not set suid permissions on xbacklight! Similarly, running
xbacklight under sudo is pointless (there's simply no reason to).
Keyboard backlight control is also available on certain laptop models via the
"leds" subsystem. The following laptop models are known to have a controllable
keyboard backlight:

Lenovo ThinkPad: -ctrl tpacpi::kbd_backlight

Apple MacBook Pro: -ctrl smc::kbd_backlight

Dell Latitude/XPS: -ctrl dell::kbd_backlight

Asus N-Series Notebooks: -ctrl asus::kbd_backlight


The following rules allow users in the video group to set the keyboard
backlight as well:

SUBSYSTEM=="leds", ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="*::kbd_backlight",
RUN+="/bin/chgrp video /sys/class/leds/%k/brightness",
RUN+="/bin/chmod g+w /sys/class/leds/%k/brightness"
